/**

 *
 You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

 Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

 The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

 The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

 Example:

 root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

               10
              /  \
             5   -3
            / \    \
           3   2   11
          / \   \
         3  -2   1

 Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

 1.  5 -> 3
 2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
 3. -3 -> 11


 ==============================
              10
             /  \
            5   -2
           / \    \
          3   2   2
         / \   \   \
        3  -2   1  -2
