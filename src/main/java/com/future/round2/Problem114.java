    /**
     * Analyze:
     * In the above straightforward solution, the time complexity is O(nh) where h is the height of tree, because we have to
     * find the tail of left subtree.
     * In the above solution, the basic idea is flatten left and right side, that means we finished all node in left side
     * and return back to process right side, when we start to process the right side, at this moment, we have the root of left subtree only.
     * The root of left subtree is useless for us, we need the tail of subtree.
     *
     * But, we need the root of right subtree, we use that to connect with the tail node of left subtree.
     * We traversal the right first, that means we will start from the right most node, we can use a variable to store it.
     *
     * for example
     *    1
     *   / \
     *  2   3
     *  After we flattened this tree, the tree looks like this:
     *   1
     *    \
     *     2
     *      \
     *       3
     *
     * @param root
