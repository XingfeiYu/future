 Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

 What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

 Note:

 You may only use constant extra space.
 For example,
 Given the following binary tree,
          1
         /  \
        2    3
       / \    \
      4   5    7
 After calling your function, the tree should look like:
              1 -> NULL
             /  \
            2 -> 3 -> NULL
           / \    \
          4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
