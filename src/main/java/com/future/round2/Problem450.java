/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/

 Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

 Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

 Search for a node to remove.
 If the node is found, delete the node.
 Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

 Example:

 root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
 key = 3

     5
    / \
   3   6
  / \   \
 2   4   7

 Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

 One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

      5
     / \
    4   6
   /     \
  2       7

 Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

            // 1. why is finding the minimum node in right subtree rather than maximum node in right subtree? or either way is ok?
            // 2. after the minimum node is found, there are two strategies:
            //     - minimum_node.left = root.left
            //     - set the root.val to minimum val, then call deleteNode(root.right, root.val) to delete minimum node in right subtree.
            //     - the first way is simple, but could change the height of tree.
