/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/description/
 *
 *
 Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value,
 where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes,
 then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

 Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

 If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

 Example 1:
 Input:
     2
    / \
   2   5
      / \
     5   7

 Output: 5
 Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
 Example 2:
 Input:
   2
  / \
 2   2

 Output: -1
 Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
