 We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

 Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

 However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

 Example:

 n = 10, I pick 8.

 First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

 Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

 You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

     * Analyze:
     * "find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win"
     * It means, the minimum money you need for any picked number between 1 to n, just need to guarantee a win.
     * So basically it's an optimal problem, think about DP.
     * First thing is how to define the state.
     * For any picked number p, the cost is $p + max(left_sub_problem, right_sub_problem), seems the state is about a range.
     * Let's use f(m, n) represents the money we need for range m to n.
     * Now, what's the state transition?
     * Since any number in range m to n could be picked, we need to find the minimum cost one.
     * And for nay number p, it has f(m, n) = $p + max(f(m, p - 1), f(p + 1), n)
     * Now, we can come out the Top-down DP solution
     * @param n
     * @return
