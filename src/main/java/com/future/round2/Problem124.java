/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/
 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

 For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the
 parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

 For example:
 Given the below binary tree,

   1
  / \
 2   3
 Return 6.
