 Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

 Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every
 edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

 The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.
 Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i,
 and it doesn't contain any element twice.

 Example 1:
 Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
 Output: true
 Explanation:
 The graph looks like this:
 0----1
 |    |
 |    |
 3----2
 We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
 Example 2:
 Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
 Output: false
 Explanation:
 The graph looks like this:
 0----1
 | \  |
 |  \ |
 3----2
 We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

 Note:

 graph will have length in range [1, 100].
 graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
 graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
 The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].
