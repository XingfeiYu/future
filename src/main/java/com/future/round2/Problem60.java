/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/
 *
 The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

 By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

 "123"
 "132"
 "213"
 "231"
 "312"
 "321"
 Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

 Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

     * Analyze:
     * The brute force solution is compute all possible permutations one by one, and find the kth permutation.
     *
     * As we know, for any number n, there are (n-1)! permutations which leading with each number from 1 to n.
     *
     * And all permutations sorted in ascending, so, given a k, it's easy to find first number.
     *
     * We can know there are 2 permutations in each line, so we can find the line easily, 4 / 2 = 2, do it recursively
     *
     * As the example above, we are given n = 3, and if we want to find 4th,
     *
     * We know there are (n-1)! permutations which consist of n digital per line, here n =3, so we have 2*1 per line.
     *
     * One line means all permutations which leading with one of digital from 1 to n, here
     *
     * 123, 132
     * 213, 231
     * 312, 321
     *
     * k/(n-1)! can find the line, here 4/2 = 2, so we got first digital 2, then we have 2 digital left, so the left thing
     * is find left k in line 2, how many k left? k - (line - 1) * (n-1)!, here left k = 4 - (2-1) * 2 =2
     * So the problem became to small problem, find the 2th in (1, 3)'s permutations.
     *
     * @param n
     * @param k
     * @return
