/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/
 *
 Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
 researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h
 citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 Example:

 Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
 received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

     * Analyze:
     * The first thing is understand why the index of example is 3.
     * Let's say,
     * - pick up 6, then the index is 1, we have to check others, 0, 1 are fine, but 3 and 5 violated rule.
     * - pick up 5 and 6, then the index is 2, 0, 1 are fine, but same as above, 3 and 5 violated rule.
     * - pick up 3, 5, 6, index is 3, all rest (0, 1) are fine, that's the valid index.
     *
     * So the straightforward way is sort first, and use two pointer left and right.
     * 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
     * index init as 0
     * while left <= right
     *  if citations[left] <= index move left
     *  else move right and index++
     *
     *  Time complexity O(nlg(n)), Space complexity O(1)
     *  beats 17%
