/**
 * Let's say we are going to implement a model to describe cars.
 * First let's define an abstract class car which contains a lot of attributes like VIN number, seats, etc.
 *
 * Then let's think about one method, pump gas, can we put this method in the abstract class?
 * If we backed to 20 years ago, properly we can, but now we can't, for example, Tesla is a car, but can't pump gas.
