    //Three major steps to implement a heap sort algorithm.
    //1. build heap
    //2. heapify
    //3. heap sort.

    //What is heap data structure?
    // Heap structure is a tree which is full filled on all levels except possibly the lowest(this tree is also known as complete tree)
    // and filled from the left up to the point.

    //The features of heap:
    //1. Heaps satisfy the heap property (for every nodes other than root, the value of node is less than or equals the value of parent,
    // that is, the value of node is at most the value of its parent).
    //2. We use an array A presents a heap, for each node i in array, we can know following things:
    //  index of parent = index of i / 2
    //  index of left child = index of i * 2
    //  index of right child = index of i * 2 + 1
    //3. It's the most important key for building heap, all elements in subarray A[n/2+1...n] are leaves of the tree.

    //Since we need to use heapify function to build a heap, so let's implement heapify first.
    // What's the parameters should be in function heapify? an array for sure, the index of node we are going to heapfy, and another one...
