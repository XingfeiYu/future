     * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters:

     * <p>
     * Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.
     * <p>
     * For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
     * <p>
     * Follow up:
     * Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.
     * <p>
     * Analyze:
     * Let's say we are given string "++++", and I'm the starting player, I can flip any two consecutive "++", and the problem
     * became to a smaller sub-problem, can my friend win the game with new string? if my friend can win, I will lose, otherwise, I will win.
     * So we can come out the straightforward way, recursion.

     * In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10.
     * The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
     * <p>
     * What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
     * <p>
     * For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement
     * until they reach a total >= 100.
     * <p>
     * Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the first player to move can
     * force a win, assuming both players play optimally.
     * <p>
     * You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.
     * <p>
     * Example
     * <p>
     * Input:
     * maxChoosableInteger = 10
     * desiredTotal = 11
     * <p>
     * Output:
     * false
     * <p>
     * Explanation:
     * No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
     * The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
     * If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
     * The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
     * Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
     * <p>
     * Analyze:
     * If I'm the starting player, I can choose any number between 1 to maxChoossableInteger (inclusive), and the problem
     * became to a smaller one, check if can competitor win the game, if competitor can win, I will lose, otherwise, I will win.
