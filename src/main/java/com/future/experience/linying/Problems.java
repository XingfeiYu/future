 *
 *  Heap vs stack
 *  - Stack is used for static memory allocation, and heap for dynamic memory allocation
 *  - Stack is allocated at compile time, and heap is allocated at running time.
 *  - Stack size is limited by physical memory size, and heap size is limited by virtual memory size.
 *  - You can use stack if you know exactly how much memory you need before compile time.
 *  - In multiple threads, each thread has independent stack but will share same heap.
