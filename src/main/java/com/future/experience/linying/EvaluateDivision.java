 * https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/description/
 * Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings,
 * and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist,
 * return -1.0.

 Example:
 Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
 queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
 return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
